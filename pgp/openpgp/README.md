# What is OpenPGP.js?
[OpenPGP.js](http://openpgpjs.org/) is a Javascript implementation of the OpenPGP protocol. This is defined in [RFC 4880](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880).

# How do I use it?
As a developer, the best place to start is in the `resources/` directory. Within this you will find a basic example implementation and the "binary" files for this library. It is likely that you will want to use `resources/openpgp.min.js` on your site, this is a minified version of our library.

# I need some help
## Mailing List
You can [sign up](http://list.openpgpjs.org/) for our mailing list and ask for help there.  We've recently worked on getting our [archive up and running](http://www.mail-archive.com/list@openpgpjs.org/).

## Documentation
A jsdoc build of our code comments is available at [doc/index.html](doc/index.html). Public calls should generally be made through the OpenPGP object [doc/openpgp.html](doc/openpgp.html).

# How do I get involved?
You want to help, great! Go ahead and fork our repo, make your changes
and make a pull request. **For any significant changes, use the "devel" branch. This will eventually be merged into the current master.** Please be sure that you run `make minify` from the root directory to concatenate and minify the library into the `resources/` directory.

It is extra awesome if you write tests for the code you change. Our test coverage is relatively weak, so if you can add cases that is great.

# What License do you use?
GNU Lesser General Public License (2.1). Please take a look at the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more information.

# What are the requirements to use it?
OpenPGP.js currently only fully supports Chrome. Firefox support should be coming soon with the advent of Firefox 23 with native javascript support for `window.crypto.getRandomValues`. If you can help us support more browsers and situations, please chip in!
